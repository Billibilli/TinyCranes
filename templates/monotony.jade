                In an attempt to create the worst game imaginable ... Monotony is a 2D point-and-click game for mobile devices, focused around incredibly boring and repetitive tasks. For example, players might be asked to watch paint dry, or water a flower-bed. In short, the core concept focuses on having the player do as little as possible while still being considered a game.
