                Sticks & Stones follows an argument between two children, each taking turns drawing on a whiteboard to resolve their differences. Their scribbles are initially benign, but as the disagreement escalates, drawings become increasingly violent. I came up with the core concept, and was responsible for the levels and pacing of enemies during each stage of the game. Created over the course of two weeks, with Cameron Chu, [Annie Sardelis](//asardelis3.wix.com/portfolio/), [Scott Todd](//scotttodd.github.io/), and David Vanderzee.
