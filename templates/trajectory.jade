                Trajectory is a 2D spaceflight simulator in which players launch rockets and other spacecraft, leveraging planetary orbits to slingshot mining probes towards distant interstellar clusters.  Collect valuable minerals, expand a fledgling space program, and perhaps discover the ruins of an ancient civilization â€¦ As the designer, I pitched the primary concept, and was responsible for tuning gameplay and mechanics based on play-tester feedback. Produced in one semester, with [Markus Gaasedelen](), [Peregrin Garet](//www.pgaret.com/), and [Andrew Morris]().
