                Exploring the motivations and thought process behind making decisions, Midnight follows the story of an unstable psychiatry professor and his research assistant as they re-enact the Milgram experiments at the remote Peacock Manor. Unravel the mystery of the manor, or stand by and watch as the research assistant begins a slow, but inexorable descent into madness.
