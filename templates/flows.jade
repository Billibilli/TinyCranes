                Position the pushers and splitters to direct each stream into its corresponding receptacle! Flows is a brain-teasing puzzler with ten levels of increasing complexity, inspired by flow control systems and motivated by a strong desire to work with WebGL and particle effects. I designed the core mechanic, and implemented the underlying web framework. Submitted to [GitHub Game-Off 2013](//github.com/github/game-off-2013) in collaboration with [Scott Todd](//scotttodd.github.io/).
