            section
                p I am currently a software development engineer with <a href="https://games.amazon.com/">Amazon Game Studios</a>. When I'm not performing ðŸ’¡âš—ðŸ”¬ mad science experiments, I write gameplay, systems, and UI/UX code for <a href="https://playbreakaway.com">Breakaway</a> and New World. Stay tuned for some awesome announcements!
                p Previously, I was a software development engineer intern inside <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>. I was exposed to a variety of image processing and video encoding domain topics while working on real-time streaming backends. Before that, I was a summer student at the <a href="http://www.nrl.navy.mil/">United States Naval Research Laboratory</a>. I performed research on experimental and theoretical projects in fields of study including: underwater electrical discharges, target tracking, and parallel computing.
