Trajectory is a 2D spaceflight simulator in which players launch rockets and other spacecraft, leveraging planetary orbits to slingshot mining probes towards distant interstellar clusters.  Collect valuable minerals, expand your space program, and perhaps discover the ruins of an ancient civilization â€¦ I pitched the primary concept. Made in a semester, with [Markus Gaasedelen](//github.com/gaasem), [Peregrin Garet](//www.pgaret.com/), and [Andrew Morris](//www.jump4r.com/).
