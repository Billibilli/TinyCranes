Sticks & Stones follows an argument between two children, each taking turns drawing on a whiteboard to resolve their differences. Their scribbles are initially benign, but as the disagreement escalates, drawings become increasingly violent. I came up with the concept, and was responsible for the level design. Created in two weeks, with Cameron Chu, [Annie Sardelis](http://asardelis3.wix.com/portfolio/), [Scott Todd](https://scotttodd.github.io/), and [David Vanderzee](mailto:dvanderzee4@gmail.com).
