Footsteps is an isometric, action-roleplaying game for the PC and major consoles, in which players follow the captivating tale of a young prince and his mentor, journeying across a mysterious, magical world.  Unlike many other roleplaying games, Footsteps examines the various decisions that shape individuals as they mature, and explores a curious theme of progressive impairment.
