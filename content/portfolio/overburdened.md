Tasked with creating an experimental game based on overpopulation and limited space, we made Overburdened. You control a burgeoning flock of birds, eating the food that appears. Birds that fly off the edge cause the edge to gradually collapse inwards, constraining available space. There is no winning, only survival. Developed in a week, with [Cameron Chu](), [Reginald Franklin](//reggame.weebly.com/), [Arthur Jones](//arthurjonesportfolio.weebly.com/), [Adam Trager](//www.adamtrager.com/).
