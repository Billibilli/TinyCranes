Inspired by [Contre temps](https://vimeo.com/71695621), Yesterday follows the story of a lost soul exploring the ruins of a flooded town. Discover various timepieces to turn back the clock and reveal more of the town. Yesterday is not just an exploration in space, but also through time. I worked mainly on the visual and level designs. This was our first foray into [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/), with Cameron Chu, [Arthur Jones](http://arthurjonesportfolio.weebly.com/), [Katie Souza](https://www.flickr.com/photos/59971147@N04/sets/), [Adam Trager](http://www.adamtrager.com/).
