Inspired by [Contre temps](//vimeo.com/71695621), Yesterday follows the story of a lost soul exploring the ruins of a flooded town. Discover various timepieces to turn back the clock and reveal more of the town. Yesterday is not just an exploration in space, but also through time. I worked mainly on the visual and level designs. This was our first foray into [Unreal Engine 4](//www.unrealengine.com/products/unreal-engine-4), with [Cameron Chu](), [Arthur Jones](//arthurjonesportfolio.weebly.com/), [Katie Souza](), [Adam Trager](//www.adamtrager.com/).
