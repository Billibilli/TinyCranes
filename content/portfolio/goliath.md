Goliath is a cooperative puzzler for two players, in which players take on complementary disabilities, and must collaborate to solve a series of seemingly insurmountable challenges. By placing players in a co-dependent state, Goliath focuses on creating deeper connections between players, as well as respectfully exploring established assumptions surrounding disabled persons.
