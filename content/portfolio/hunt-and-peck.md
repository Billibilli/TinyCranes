Challenged with a theme of physical space, Hunt & Peck is an experimental mashup between Twister and Pro Wrestling (NES), featuring 8-bit fighting, randomized controls, catchy music, and absolute hilarity! Play this if you want a fun and goofy experience in which two may enter, and only one can leave ... Collectively programmed in Unity over a span of three days, with [Alex Foo](//alexanderfooportfolio.weebly.com/), [Arthur Jones](//arthurjonesportfolio.weebly.com/), and [Dustin Tsui]().
