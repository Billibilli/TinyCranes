Winter explores themes of pursuit, warmth, and catharsis. Shadow the wolf as it leads you through the forest, seeking something mysterious. Reach the end and discover a terrible truth. I helped brainstorm the concept, and later implemented the wolf navigation and path-finding algorithms. Made in Unity and featured in the [Rensselaer Game Showcase](//gamedev.union.rpi.edu/rgs-home/rgs/), with [David Allen](//ludimotion.com/), [Ryan Gimson](//github.com/Gimsor/), [Neale Johnson](//diokatsu.wix.com/portfolio/), and [Andrew Morris](//www.jump4r.com/).
