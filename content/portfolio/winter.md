Winter explores themes of pursuit, warmth, and catharsis. Shadow the wolf as it leads you through the forest, seeking something mysterious. Reach the end and discover a terrible truth. I helped brainstorm the concept, and later implemented the wolf navigation and path-finding algorithms. Made in Unity and featured in the [Rensselaer Game Showcase](http://gamedev.union.rpi.edu/rgs-home/rgs/), with [David Allen](http://ludimotion.com/), Ryan Gimson, [Neale Johnson](http://diokatsu.wix.com/portfolio/), and [Andrew Morris](http://www.jump4r.com/).
