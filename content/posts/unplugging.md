I quit Facebook today. More precisely: I installed a plugin to disable the news feed, deleted Facebook from my browser's predictive suggestions, and cleared all related browser history. I doubt I'll ever be totally free of Facebook's grasp -- the convenience of Facebook login and an easy way to contact the people I know via Messenger remain immensely powerful tools -- but at least this is a step in the right direction.
