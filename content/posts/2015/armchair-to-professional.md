title: From Armchair to Professional

It recently occurred to me that in graduating from college, I have also graduated from *armchair game developer* to *professional game developer* ... wait, what does that even mean?  Not much apparently. If anything, the path ahead is more clouded than before. As a student, I merely aspired to enter the games industry in any way, shape, or form. If you told me four years ago that I would be working for a major game studio fresh out of college, I would have laughed at you.

Now that I have a (very junior) seat at the table, I look up the food chain and am entirely stumped by the question "so what do you want to do?" What do I want to become? I'm terrified because I have no idea. All I can think of is that the game industry needs more role models. Offhand, there are people like John Carmack, Ken Levine, Sid Meier, *legends* in the game industry. But where are all the people in between? Where are the people that are the lifeblood of a studio, but that the games media neglected to instead fawn over the next "indie game developer superstar!"?

Hah! And I bet you thought this would be some mindless platitudes about reinforcing my credibility as a "professional" game developer! Guess what? *I'm just as clueless as you armchair game developers.*
