Apple advertises up to 9 hours of battery life for the MacBook Pro, yet I consistently clocked in around 5 hours. Lunchtime was determined the needs of my computer. Where I ate was dictated by whether or not there was an outlet available nearby. For months, I went through this routine, until I reformatted my computer at the start of the semester, only this time I neglected to reinstall Google Chrome. Chalk it up to extreme laziness I guess. Little did I know ...

My battery life skyrocketed. I went for 11 hours straight once, no outlets to be seen. This was vastly superior than even the advertised battery life! I soon started chanting "Safari on battery, Chrome at home" in my mind. Soon, I was spending so much time on battery, I set Safari to my default browser. Incidentally, it is fascinating how much sticking power the "Default" browser has.

I began investigating how to switch to Safari for good. I'm not a huge extensions user, so that was an easy win; all the popular extensions are available for every major browser. Beyond that, I depended on the Chrome Password Manager to sync my logins across devices. 1Password takes care of that for me now. Flash is a mostly dead medium and if I do come across a Flash video, I can just fire up Chrome.

The last holdout might be my heavy use of the Chrome Developer Tools, but even then, I can just fire up Chrome when testing, like I have to do for Firefox anyway. For day-to-day usage, a browser is just a browser. For the most part, Safari gets the job done, and with my recent discovery of `⌘⌥R` for responsive development, mobile development is much smoother than the equivalent interfaces in Chrome or Firefox. Now if only I could make everything play nicely under Windows, that would just about put the final nail in the coffin ...
